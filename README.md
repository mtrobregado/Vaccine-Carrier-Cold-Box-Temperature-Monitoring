  Project Description:
  - AWS IOT EduKit, collect sensor data via UART from a Texas Instruments Sub 1-Ghz sensor network, 
    and send these data to AWS IOT. Sub 1-Ghz sensor network consist of collector and sensor nodes. 
    Each sensor node is attached to a vaccine carrier cold box.
  
  Hardware:
  - AWS IOT EduKit
  - CC1352R Launchpad (collector)
  - LPSTK-CC1352R (sensor node connected to vaccine carrier cold box)
